= Hello.

I am Andy Van Den Heuvel, senior full stack developer at [Optis](http://www.optis.be).

My focus is mainly on Java and Javascript, but I enjoy playing around with all sorts of interesting and upcoming technologies.

I have work experience at national and international organisations as well as social and public services , including [3M](http://www.3m.com),
[AXA](https://www.axa.com/), [BNP Paribas Fortis](https://www.bnpparibasfortis.be), [BMW](http://www.bmw.com),
[Euroclear](https://www.euroclear.com), [Flemish government](https://www.vlaanderen.be/en), [Proximus](https://www.proximus.be), [VDAB](https://www.vdab.be) and [Toyota](https://www.toyota.com).

I'm also working on some open source projects, mainly [Koara](koara.html).

When not behind the screen, I love to run and to travel around the world.
I am happily married to my wonderful wife. We live together in [Antwerp, Belgium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Antwerp,+Belgium).
